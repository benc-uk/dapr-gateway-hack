# Dapr Gateway Hack Project

This repo contains some of the work required to allow Dapr to make cross network calls, e.g. from one cluster to another by the means of a TCP gateway.

This was done as part of Microsoft CSE One Week 2021, and is a proof of concept rather than a full robust implementation

Thanks to all the team, the work in this repo represents much of their efforts and input üòÅ
